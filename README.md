This repository contains the code for a Frogger-style game in Unity.

The videos for this game and more can be found on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/sloankelly) channel.

# Branches
Each time a video is released, the code for that video is stored in a 'video' branch. e.g. the first video will be in release/video-1. If you need the source for a specific video, please pull down that branch. For the most recent video, you can use the master branch.
